How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you
see the bug that was introduced?

It was pretty clear because the difference between just few rows was obvious. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I always allows me to go back to early versions of code to make it better. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manually I can decide is it worth to save this version or not, which make history
cleaner. Automatically saved changes are insurance for inexpected loss of code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files
 in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
 
 Because of usage of these two VCS. Developers usually work with multiply files 
 connected one to another, while Google docs usually used to work with just one file.
 
 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 
 You type git log first to see id's of required commint and than git diff them to 
 see the difference. 
 
 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 
It allows easily to go back to working code, so I'll be more confident.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For android development.
