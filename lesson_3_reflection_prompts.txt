When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm not the only one who works on the project or need to acces my code from different
computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are "clones" of repository on GitHub. Clones are copied repositories on local machine or GitHub.
Branches are branches. 
I would use branches when I want to try something I'm not sure will work or just wanna try something,
clones if I need copy of directory, forks if author needs recognition.  

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So i can compare my code to that state without Internet connection.
