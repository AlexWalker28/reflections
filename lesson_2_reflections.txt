What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git file adds to directory and gonna save metadata of this repository.
I need it to save history of file changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
 Staging area temporary stores files that will (or won't) be  commited later.
 Working directory and repository are "final" storages for files. 

 How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
 I can use -diffs all the way to make sure. 
 
 What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
 How would branches help?
 
 It would help when i decide to make some experimental changes to my code, which I'm not
 completely sure will work or for any other reason don't want in my main code yet. Braches
 allows to do it easily.
