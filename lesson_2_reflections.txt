What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git file adds to directory and gonna save metadata of this repository.
I need it to save history of file changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?
 Staging area temporary stores files that will (or won't) be  commited later.
 Working directory and repository are "final" storages for files.
